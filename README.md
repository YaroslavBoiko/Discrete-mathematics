GENERAL USAGE NOTES
===================

-This program calculates the number of transitive matrices
  The user selects the size of the matrix on his / her own choice
  Possible size 3 (3 by 3) or 4 (4 by 4)

- When you start the program you need enter a number

- The structure of the program:

  I used libraries NumPy and Random

  The program consists of 4 functions
       First function  (def generate_matrix(n))generates a random matrix
       Second  function def (All(n)) generates all possible matrices
       Third function (def is_transitive(matrix)) checks if the matrix is transitive
       And the last function (def fin(n))  returns the number of transitive matrices

- Programming language-Python(3.6.3)
